# aescrypt

Currently a work in progress

aescrypt is a function designed to encrypt/decrypt binary files given a cipher key with accordance to AES-128. aescrypt is 
designed with the intent of simplying the effort requried by the user with regards to not only encrypting and decryptiong binary
files, but in addition being able to easily extract files within the binary code (e.x. .txt, .sql, etc).  aescrypt is designed
to be executed via command line with the hex key located in cipher.txt within the same directory as the binary file.
